# MpesaSDK
After many hours of researching for a gem or article explaining the process of intergrating M-Pesa SDK Push to ruby on rails but kept on hitting multiple dead ends. I decided to do create a Rails mini app api to demo the basics of a simple SDK Push and polling (checking if payment is successfull or might have encounted any errors)
## Requirements
1. M-Pesa Daraja Account and a Sandbox app
2. Ruby on Rails
3. Ngrok: A cross-platform application that enables developers to expose a local development server to the Internet with minimal effort. It makes your software locally hosted web server appears to be  hosted on a subdomain  of ngrok.com, meaning that no public Ip/Domain name on the local machine is needed.
4. Ruby Gems -> rest-client 2.0 and rack-cors
